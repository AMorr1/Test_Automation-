##Website Automation Testing using Selenium and TestNG

Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.

TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language created by CÃ©dric Beust and inspired by JUnit and NUnit. 
The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc., with more powerful and easy-to-use functionalities.

The main objective is to test the internshala website using all different methods done in lab till now. To do so we used the following classes:-

Login :- Validation using assert and the parameterized data for the automation script build in starting

Register :- Testng method (before class , after class , Test priority etc.)

ExtentReport :- Integrate extent report with automation scripts for result reporting

AllCases :- To create several test on website like login , search , contact us and apply to job.

Jenkins :-Integrate automation scripts with Jenkins for execution on build deployment
